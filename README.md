## 02-guess-location-backend
The second project in the "SkillUp Mentor" program. <br/>
The API allows users after signing up and/or signing in to post a location which contains a location name, latitude, longitude and a picture of the location. The authenticated users can then add guesses which contain the latitude and longitude. The backend then calculates the error distance from the original coordinates and the user guessed coordinates. The api can also retrieve the locations and guesses which are sorted accordingly. Users can also change their password, information and profile image. If the user forgets his password he can request that a password reset link is sent to his email.
